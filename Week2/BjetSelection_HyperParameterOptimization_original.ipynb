    "# Classification of b-quark jets in the Aleph simulated data\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an introduction to using Machine Learning (ML) - in particular Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) - for trying to determine, if an entry in a data file is of one type (signal, ill, guilty, etc.) or another (background, healthy, innocent, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may choose between two data samples:\n",
    "1. A particle physics dataset containing simulated decays of the $Z^0$ boson decaying to a quark and an anti-quark producing two \"jets\" of particles. The question is, if the jets are from a b-quark (b-jet) or from lighter quarks (l-jet).\n",
    "3. A \"medical\" dataset which concers a lifestyle disease in relation to various (transformed) lifestyle variables (reduced in number of variables to match the Aleph b-jet data set).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we discuss the problem from the b-jet point of view, as this is where the largest size datasets are available. However, we stress that from the point of view of ML, data content (what is being considered) is not essential to know (for now!!!). And knowing the content in details requires domain knowledge, i.e. that you are an expert in the specific field, that the data comes from. This part is very important, but not the focus in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, this exercise is the simple start \"outside ML\" and moving into the territory of Machine Learning analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data:\n",
    "The input variables (X) are (used by Aleph for their NN):\n",
    "* **prob_b**: Probability of being a b-jet from the pointing of the tracks to the vertex.\n",
    "* **spheri**: Sphericity of the event, i.e. how spherical it is.\n",
    "* **pt2rel**: The transverse momentum squared of the tracks relative to the jet axis, i.e. width of the jet.\n",
    "* **multip**: Multiplicity of the jet (in a relative measure).\n",
    "* **bqvjet**: b-quark vertex of the jet, i.e. the probability of a detached vertex.\n",
    "* **ptlrel**: Transverse momentum (in GeV) of possible lepton with respect to jet axis (about 0 if no leptons).\n",
    "\n",
    "Auxilary variables (Z) are (not used by Aleph for their NN):\n",
    "* energy: Measured energy of the jet in GeV. Should be 45 GeV, but fluctuates.\n",
    "* cTheta: cos(theta), i.e. the polar angle of the jet with respect to the beam axis. Note, that the detector works best in the central region (|cTheta| small) and less well in the forward regions.\n",
    "* phi:    The azimuth angle of the jet. As the Aleph detector was essentially uniform in phi, this should not matter (much).\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable (Y) is:\n",
    "* **isb**:    1 if it is from a b-quark and 0, if it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, those before you (the Aleph collaboration in the mid 90'ies) produced a Neural Net (6 input variables, two hidden layers with 10 neurons in each, and 1 output varible) based classification variable, which you can compare to (and compete with?):\n",
    "* **nnbjet**: Value of original Aleph b-jet tagging algorithm, using only the last six variables (for reference).\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you choose **the medical data**, the variables to use as input (X) are: **Qsocial, BMI, Roccupat, Rgenetic, Rdietary, and Rhormonn** (reflecting Quantiles and Ratios of medical measurements). The target variable (Y) is (naturally): **TrulyIll**, and you can compare your results to the average of doctors: **DocScore**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Task this weak:\n",
    "\n",
    "### HyperParameter optimization (here for LightGBM model):\n",
    "\n",
    "The following exercise is about HyperParameter (HP) optimization. Your task is to find the HPs that gives the best performance for your model. In order to avoid statistical fluctuations we use 50000 events (but you may eventually decide to use more).\n",
    "\n",
    "The are many things to tune in LigthGBM, see this long [list of HPs for LightGBM algorithm](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parameters-Tuning.html). In order to limit ourselves, you should in the following only consider (at least to begin with) the following five HPs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of tree\n",
    "* Number of leaves\n",
    "* Learning rate\n",
    "* Boosting (how to combine trees: 1. Traditional Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, or [DART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01866))\n",
    "* Minimum data in each leave (use this to avoid over-fitting)\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose is to get the best possible performance out.\n",
